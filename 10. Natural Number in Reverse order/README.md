## 📜 Program Details

### 📄 File Name: 
- `10. Natural Number in Reverse order`

### ✨ Features:
- Takes an integer `n` as input from the user.
- Prints all natural numbers from `n` to 1 in reverse order.
- Handles edge cases, such as input less than 1, gracefully.

### 🛠️ Techniques Used:
1. **For loop** to iterate from the given number down to 1.
2. Conditional checks to validate input.
