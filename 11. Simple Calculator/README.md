## 📜 Program Details

### 📄 File Name: 
- `11. Simple Calculator`

### ✨ Features:
- Allows the user to choose an operation: 
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
- Takes two numbers as input from the user.
- Performs the selected operation and displays the result.
- Includes error handling for invalid operations and division by zero.

### 🛠️ Techniques Used:
1. Conditional statements (`if-else`) or `switch` for operation selection.
2. Basic arithmetic operators for calculations.
3. Input validation to handle edge cases (e.g., division by zero).
