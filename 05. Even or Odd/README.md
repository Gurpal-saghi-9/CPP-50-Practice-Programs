## 📜 Program Details

### 📄 File Name: 
- `05. Even or Odd`

### ✨ Features:
- Takes an integer as input from the user.
- Determines if the number is even or odd using the modulus operator (`%`).
- Outputs whether the number is even or odd.

### 🛠️ Techniques Used:
- Conditional statements (`if-else`).
- Modulus operator to check divisibility by 2.
