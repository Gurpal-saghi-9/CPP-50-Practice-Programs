# 🔢 Check Armstrong Number

This folder contains a C++ program to determine whether a given number is an **Armstrong number**. An Armstrong number (also known as a Narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits raised to the power of the number of digits.

## 📜 Program Details

### 📄 File Name: 
- `08. Amstrog number`

### ✨ Features:
- Takes an integer as input from the user.
- Calculates the sum of its digits raised to the power of the total number of digits.
- Compares the calculated sum with the original number to check if it is an Armstrong number.
- Outputs whether the number is an Armstrong number or not.

### 🛠️ Techniques Used:
1. Loop to extract digits from the number.
2. Power function (`pow()` from `<cmath>`) to calculate powers.
3. Conditional statements (`if-else`) to check the Armstrong condition.
